CASTLE WEEL OF DOOM:

Code made to work with HTML and CSS, the idea is to doom one of the persons in the list. 

We created a DB in which we can keep track of the doomed persons on the list. 

This app has a halloween stile and the door is positioned with Grid and all actions are 
made using solely CSS.
